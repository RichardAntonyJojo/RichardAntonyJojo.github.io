    <h2>About Me ;</h2>
    <p> Adress       : Nedumkallel House,Krishnapuram,Ollukkara p.o<br>

    <p>I am a Btech student studying at Sahrdaya Collage of Enginnering .
      <br> I chose to pursue my carrier as a Computer Enginner and hope to work in Adobe.

  One of the most crucial skills an engineer can possess is strong problem-solving abilities. A large part of an engineer’s job is assessing a situation, identifying problems and then finding solutions. Employers will want to see that you’re capable of handling obstacles in your daily work.

  Example: “Adept at identifying problems resulting in inoperable production machinery, troubleshooting potential causes and devising a solution to return the machine to operating condition as promptly as possible.”<br>



  No matter what field of engineering you are working in, it is likely that you will be required to use computers to do your job effectively. Skills like programming are valuable across a broad range of engineering disciplines and are appealing to prospective employers.

  Example: “Utilized computer modeling programs to develop simulations for structural designs and test the load capacity before finalization of project blueprints.”<br>


  A hiring professional must be able to determine if you are capable of performing as an engineer in the field of the company for which you are applying. If you don’t have direct experience in the field, assess which of your skills are most relevant and highlight them in your prior engineering positions.

  Example: “Performed inspections on active construction projects by contractors, ensuring that all materials and methods being used are to the design specifications, and all craftsmanship is of requisite quality for safe construction.”



  Engineering projects can be challenging, so a candidate needs to be reliable under stress. By highlighting your ability to deliver in difficult situations, you can make yourself appealing to potential employers.<br>

  Example:  “Managed a team of engineers constructing a new prototype model on an accelerated timeline to have the test model available in time for demo at a major convention that could not be rescheduled, resulting in rave reviews from the press following the debut presentation.”


  Few engineering projects will see an engineer working on their own without coworkers or outside professionals. Teamwork skills are essential for ensuring you can cooperate with teammates to succeed as a unit and perform to your highest combined ability.<br>

  Example: “Worked alongside a team of five engineers to develop new body design, increase aerodynamics and improve overall fuel economy.”



  Often when attempting to find a solution to an engineering problem, you may not have direct experience with an identical problem or need. In these situations, a creative mind can combine prior experiences in new ways to create a solution to the problem. Creativity is a very important skill that employers will be on the lookout for in your resume.

  Example: “Constructed a customized guide for use with a table saw to allow the carpentry team to more easily create required pieces of lumber, significantly reducing construction time for each project.”<br>



  One common requirement in several engineering fields is the need to perform structural analysis. This skill involves determining the strains that would be placed on a structure or machine under current designs and assessing the ability to withstand those strains. Prior experience with structural analysis shows a potential employer that you are capable of making the calculations required to confirm that proposed plans are safe and functional.

  Example: “Performed quality checks on all new constructions after initial framing to ensure that structural integrity levels were sufficient to continue in the construction process.”<br>


  When working in engineering, you will often need to discuss plans or designs with others. The ability to clearly communicate is essential to collaborative work. It is particularly important when working with non-engineers, as the engineer must take technical information and convey it clearly to those without advanced technical knowledge. This way, progress and options are understood by everyone involved.

  Example: “Met weekly with executives and department managers to discuss the status of all ongoing engineering projects. Explained current projects in terms that all in attendance could understand and delivered updates on planned progress for the upcoming week.” </p>
